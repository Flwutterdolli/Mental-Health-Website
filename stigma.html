    <h1> The Stigma Around Mental Health.</h1>
    <h2>The Facts on Stigma, Prejudice and Discrimination</h2>
    <p>Stigma often comes from lack of understanding or fear. Inaccurate or misleading media representations of mental illness contribute to both those factors. A review of studies on stigma shows that while the public may accept the medical or genetic nature of a mental health disorder and the need for treatment, many people still have a negative view of those with mental illness.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Public stigma involves the negative or discriminatory attitudes that others may have about mental illness.</li>
      <li>Self-stigma refers to the negative attitudes, including internalized shame, that people with mental illness may have about their own condition. </li>
      <li>Structural stigma is more systemic, involving policies of government and private organizations that intentionally or unintentionally limit opportunities for people with mental illness. Examples include lower funding for mental illness research or fewer mental health services relative to other health care.</li>
